## What exactly is this Heroku?

Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Our platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market. “heroku.com”

What adds the cherry on top is that one can even deploy their entire database even though the space is limited but it is amazing right? It took me about three full days to finally come face to face with deploying. I mean I kept on finding reasons in my head to procrastinate deploying, I would look for bugs to fix which is helpful, but then I stuck to this idea that I wanna deploy a full working project with design and efficiency but what I was missing was time wasn’t on my side.

At the end of the day there, I had a fully working app as efficiently as I could get it but with no way for users to access it because I couldn’t face my fears.. I watched a few videos that were a bit off the charts.. Read the docs till I could make sense of what was implied and there I was skipping around like a little baby filled with adrenaline, Nevertheless, it was an awesome challenge and with that out of the way, I can call myself a javascript full stack developer yey! :)
