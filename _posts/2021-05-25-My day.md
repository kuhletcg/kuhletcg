Today they gave us a project. They said we must you express and MongoDB.
So I was checking an express.
Express is a web application framework for Node. js that allows you to spin up robust APIs and web servers in a much easier and cleaner way. It is a lightweight package that does not obscure the core Node.

## How do I set up an Express server?

- Create a project for express js
- Installing express js
- Create server
- Basic routing
- Serve static files Express generator

Express provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb ( GET, POST, SET, etc.) and URL pattern ("Route"), and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used, where template files are located, and what template to use to render a response.

## In conclusion

What I have learned today is that Node. js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. Express. js is a framework based on Node.
