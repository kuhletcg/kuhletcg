## Introduction

I want to share what I was doing today. Today I was busy with the free code camp projects (Front end development libraries projects).
I am not done yet but I managed to complete some of the projects,I have completed three projects, only two projects left now.

## Body

While I was doing a drum machine I faced challenges they why I did three projects if I was not struggling to build a drum machine I would have finished four projects. Tomorrow I will try to firer out where was the problem by tomorrow by tomorrow I want to get rid of them all.

## Change Text with click EventsPassed

When the click event happens, you can use JavaScript to update an HTML element.

For example, when a user clicks the Get Message button, it changes the text of the element with the class message to say Here is the message.

This works by adding the following code within the click event:

document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].textContent="Here is the message";
Add code inside the onclick event handler to change the text inside the message element to say Here is the message.

## Solution

document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].textContent="Here is the message";
