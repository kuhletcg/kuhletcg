Today I was busy with the project that Moral gave us and I am stuck I don't know how to solve this problem. My app is giving me an error I don't know what have I done wrong. I did research about the error but still, I failed to figure out the problem.

This is the error I am failing to solve(Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property 'data).

- });
- })
- .catch((err) => {
- dispatch(getErrors(err.response.data, err.response.status));
-     dispatch({ type: AUTH_ERROR });
-     });
- };

Monday I will ask Moral to help me because I really don't know what have I done wrong.
