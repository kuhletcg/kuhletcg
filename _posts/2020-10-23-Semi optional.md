# Introduction
My week was hectic. This week Moral gave us an activity about objects, so I was busy with it. Then Tuesday I was doing code wars(Semi-optional) and FreeCode camp.

# Body

## First step we were required to list students
 
var list =[
{name: "John", marks:30},
 {name: "Kuhle", marks:59},
{name: "Sizwe", marks:40},
{name: "Atli", marks:36},
{name: "Angel", marks:50},
{name: "Nozie", marks:89},

];
console.log(student);

## Second step is to display students names
var arr = [ "John", "Kuhle", "Sizwe", "Atli", "Angel", "Nozie"];

var myString = JSON.stringify(arr);
console.log(arr);

## Code wars kate(Semi-optional)

## Description

We have implemented a functioning wrap(value) that takes a value of arbitrary type and wraps it in a new Javascript Object setting the 'value' key on the new Object to the passed-in value.

So, for example, if we execute the following code:

## Solution

function wrap(value) {
  return({value });
  }

# Conclusion

On Friday Sabelo was teaching us about for loops
