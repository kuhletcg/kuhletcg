# Introduction
My week it has been stressful because we were required to do code wars.
I was clueless about it and its trick.

## Body
Code wars is more challenging but I'm willing to learn more about it.
The test that we wrote Thursday wasn't easy but I think I have tried.
I want to share what I understand about strings.

### Strings
In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type
for a single character. Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double
quotes, or backticks.


For example:
let single = 'single-quoted';
let double = "double-quoted";

let backticks = `backticks`;

#### Conclusion
I was busy but I had a good time.
