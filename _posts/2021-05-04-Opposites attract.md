Today I was busy with free code and code wars. I also checked how does express works with react.

## What is react Express?

Express is a minimal and flexible node. ... js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications;

## Can you use Express With react?

But if you just remember that React isn't an application, but a set of files, then you'll have no problem integrating Express with React in any way you'd like. One simple way is to use Express's static file server to server files to the browser that contains your React app.

## Description:

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

## solution

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
return flower1 % 2 !== flower2 % 2;
}
