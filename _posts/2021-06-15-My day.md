## Introduction

Today I was busy trying to understand t to understand MongoDB application structure. Companies and development teams of all sizes use MongoDB because The document data model is a powerful way to store and retrieve data that allows developers to move fast. MongoDB's horizontal, scale-out architecture can support huge volumes of both data and traffic.

## Body

MongoDB is an Open Source, NoSQL database management system.

## MongoDB Application Structure

## MongoDB applications consist of the three basic components:

- Establish a connection to a MongoDB instance
- Logic to access and manipulate database data
- Close the connection to the MongoDB instance

It means you can store your records without worrying about the data structure such as the number of fields or types of fields to store values. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects.

Once a connection has been established the application is ready to access and manipulate documents in the database. The first step in this process is to define the document collection within the database.

Itâ€™s important to make note of the fact that instead of using callbacks in our MongoDB function calls we are instead using Javascript Promises.
