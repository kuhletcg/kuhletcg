## Introduction

My day was busy, today I was busy with free code camp projects (Visualize data with a bar chart). I was required to build a bar chart with HTML and javaScript. I was also busy with Moral's project (TCG-student-tracker). So far done with a form the only thing left is the functionality of the form.
I have completed the bar chart so I left with four projects to complete.
Tomorrow I will continue with free code camp projects.

## Body

## I had to follow the following instructions

1. My chart should have a title with a corresponding id=" title".

2. My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id=" x-axis".

3. My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".

4. Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with a corresponding class=" tick".

5. My chart should have a rect element for each data point with a corresponding class="bar" displaying the data.

6. Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-GDP containing date and GDP values.

7. The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data.

8. The bar elements' data-GDP properties should match the order of the provided data.

9. Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.

10. The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.

11. The data-GDP attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.

12. I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id=" tooltip" which displays more information about the area.

13. My tooltip should have a data-date property that corresponds to the data date of the active area.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I can say I have learned something with I was building bar chat, and it was not to do x-axis and y-axis with a corresponding id but then I managed to find the solution.
