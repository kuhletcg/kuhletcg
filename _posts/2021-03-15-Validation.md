# Verification in Software Testing

Verification in Software Testing is a process of checking documents, design, code, and program in order to check if the software has been built according to the requirements or not. The main goal of the verification process is to ensure the quality of software application, design, architecture, etc. The verification process involves activities like reviews, walkthroughs, and inspection.

# Validation in Software Testing

Validation in Software Testing is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not. The process helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment. The validation process involves activities like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

# Javascript forms

If a form field (fname) is empty, this function alerts a message, and returns false, to prevent the form from being submitted:

## JavaScript Example

- function validateForm() {
- var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
- if (x == "") {
- alert("Name must be filled out");
- return false;
- }
- }

# Data Validation

Data validation is the process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful.

## Typical validation tasks are:

- has the user filled in all required fields?
- has the user entered a valid date?
- has the user entered text in a numeric field?
- Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct user input.
