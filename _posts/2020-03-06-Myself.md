# Introduction
I want to share with you what I learned today.
## Body
Today I was doing a website and I learned what a background color does.The background color property allows you to choose the color of your element.
This can be the background for the entire page or paragraph on a website.
### Example of setting the background color for a web page to green
e.i body{background-color}: green
#### Blackground image
You can use the background-image property to set an image as a background for an element.
The image is repeated by default so that it covers the entire element.
You can also link picture or gifs that you find online by using their link (from a google image search)
##### Conclution
The coding ground helped me too much even though I am facing some challenges but I will work hard to face those challenges.
