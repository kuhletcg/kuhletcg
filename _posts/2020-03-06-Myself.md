# Introdution
I want to share with you what I learned today.
## Body
Today I was doing website and I learned what a background color do.The background color property allows you to choose color of your element.
This can be the background for the entire page or paragraphy on a website.
### Example of setting the background color for a wed page to green
e.i body{background-color}: green
####Blackground image\
You can use the background image property to set an image as a background for an element.
The image is repeated by default so that it covers the entire element.
You can also link picter or gifs that you find online by using thier link (from a google image search)
#####Conclution
The coding ground helped me too much even though I am facing some challengs but I will work hard to face those challenges.
