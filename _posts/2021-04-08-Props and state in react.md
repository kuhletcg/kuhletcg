## What are props and state in react?

In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables but directly initialized and managed by the component. The state can be initialized by props. For example, a parent component might include a child component by calling.

## Why state is used in react?

React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

## How do you pass props in react?

Basically, that's how props are passed to React components. As you may have noticed, props are only passed from top to bottom in React's component tree. There is no way to pass props up to a parent component.

## How do I change the prop value in react?

You would change the prop in the parent component, as that is what holds the value of the prop itself. This would force a re-render of any child components that use the specific prop being changed. If you want to intercept the props as they're sent, you can use the lifecycle method componentWillReceiveProps.

## Types of Props

- Hand props are anything handled or carried by an actor. ...
- Personal props are props worn or carried by a particular actor and issued to him rather than stored on the prop table.
- Set props include most obviously furniture. ...
- Set dressing consists of similar items, but which the actor doesn't usually handle.

## What is the difference between props and set?

Basically, any item that an actor touches becomes a prop. Everything else you see in the shot, clothes hanging in a closet or things on the shelf in the background is considered set design.
