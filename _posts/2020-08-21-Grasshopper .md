# Introduction
 I wanna share what I was busy with this week.

 # Body
 On Monday they gave us a presentation about how we should solve the problem.
 They gave us different steps that we should follow.
 1. Identify and understand the problem.
 2.Discus where the problem is.
 3.Pseudocode

 Tuesday I was busy with Grasshopper kata and free code camp.
 While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called check alive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

check alive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

The function receives one parameter health which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.

Solution
Function checkAlive (health) {
  return health <= 0 ? false : true;
}
 
 Friday we wrote a test South African big five. We were required to have a view of the list of 
 the list of the big 5 animals and when you click on each, it should take to a details view
 of that selected animal.
