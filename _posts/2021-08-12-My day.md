Today I checked to hash password and save it in MongoDB.

Creating a New Node.js Project with Express.js and MongoDB Support
To get started, we’re going to create a new Node.js project. The assumption is that you already have a MongoDB instance to play around with.

We’ll be discussing the register and login endpoints shortly, but the dump endpoint will allow us to see what’s in our collection as defined by the UserModel data model.

Hashing and Validating Passwords for Safe Storage in the MongoDB NoSQL Database
With the boilerplate code out of the way, we can take a look at actually hashing our data and then comparing it to validate it. We’re going to use the typical registration and login scenario. Passwords are always sensitive so we must hash them and when we log in, we need to validate our plaintext request data with the hashed data that is stored.

What I know is that When the user wishes to sign in, we can proceed to doing some validation:

app.post("/login", async (request, response) => {
try {
var user = await UserModel.findOne({ username: request.body.username }).exec();
if(!user) {
return response.status(400).send({ message: "The username does not exist" });
}
if(!Bcrypt.compareSync(request.body.password, user.password)) {
return response.status(400).send({ message: "The password is invalid" });
}
response.send({ message: "The username and password combination is correct!" });
} catch (error) {
response.status(500).send(error);
}
});
