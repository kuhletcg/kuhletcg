## Introduction

Today Moral gave us a project. He said we must create an employee admin form so I was busy with my project. We are required to use react, redux, express, and MongoDB.

## Body

So far I have created an employee form and use form. Tomorrow I will busy with buttons(submit and edit button). I also busy with free code camp and I have completed some kata.

## Example: 1

## Description

Create a method take that accepts a list/array and a number n, and returns a list/array of the first n elements from the list/array.

- If you need help, here's a reference:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice

## Solution

function take(arr, n) {
return arr.slice(0, n);
}

## Example: 2

## Description:

I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.
Can you figure out what's wrong here?

## Solution

function swapValues(arr) {
return arr.reverse()
}

## Conclusion

Tomorrow I will continue with my project.
