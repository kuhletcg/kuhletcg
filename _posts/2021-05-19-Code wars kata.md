Today I was busy with code wars and also checked firebase authorization because I have to use firebase authorization in Moral's project and I am still stuck.

## Description

Given a string of arbitrary length with any ASCII characters. Write a function to determine whether the string contains the whole word "English".

The order of characters is important -- a string "abcEnglishdef" is correct but "abcnEglishsef" is not correct.

Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "English" is also correct.

Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "English", false for it does not.

## Solution

## Do you speak "English"?

- function spEng(sentence){
- return /english/i.test(sentence)
- }

- The Firebase Realtime Database lets you build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.
