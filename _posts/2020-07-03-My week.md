# Introduction
My week was hectic but I had a great time, even though I was facing some with Javascript.

## Body
This week I was busy with typingClub and free code camp. I realized that Javascript is more challenging and I was struggling somewhere but I managed to deal with those challenges.
Goggle is more helpful because every time if they are something I don't understand I used goggle.
Today Moral gave us a presentation about Javascript so now I have a clue about Javascript.

 ### Typed of Variables

var one =1;  // numeric value

one = 'one'; // string value

one= 1.1; // decimal value

one = true; // Boolean value

one = null; // null value
