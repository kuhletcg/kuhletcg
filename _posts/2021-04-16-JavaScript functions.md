# Introduction

My day was hectic, I was busy with Moral's project and I was also busy with the javaScript function. Today Moral and Njabulo gave use katas about function and we're not allowed to using other methods except for loop. Yeah, I was struggling there and there because I was no longer up for a loop like before but then I managed to found solutions for myself.
I just told myself I want to do this katas and I want to get them correct.

They gave us another kata but I've done it yet because I had a lot of work to do. On Monday the first thing I am going to do is to complete that kata.

# Body

## What is a for loop JavaScript?

The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: ... for/in - loops through the properties of an object.

## Examples

## Write function that returns an array of positive numbers

- function getPositiveNumber(numbers) {
- let positiveNumbers = [];
- for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
- if (numbers[i] > 0) {
- positiveNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
  - }
  - }
  - return positiveNumbers;
- }
- console.log(getPositiveNumber([6, -1, 4, -8, 10]));

## Print out numbers from 0-20

- for (var i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
- console.log(i);
- }

# Conclusion

In conclusion after today section, I have learned many things about for loop, I think if they continue to give us katas it's gonna help me too much.
