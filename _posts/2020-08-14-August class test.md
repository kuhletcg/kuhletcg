## Introduction

My week was hectic and Friday they gave us an unexpected test.
 
## Body

To that test, we were required to create a new repo, write a Javascript
program to sort any 5 numbers without using the build-in javascript sort function. 
Also , required to write a function that returns a give string letter. 
I was clueless about this but I able to work out the statement.

## Conclusion 

I thought the test will be easy but I had to use the internet.
