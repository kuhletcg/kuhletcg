## What does it mean to persist data?

Persistence is "the continuance of an effect after its cause is removed". In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage.

## What is persistent data in a database?

Persistent data in the field of data processing denotes information that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. Static data is information, for example, a record, that does not change and may be intended to be permanent. It may have previously been categorized as persistent or dynamic.

## What is a persistent data model?

In computing, a persistent data structure is a data structure that always preserves
the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively
immutable, as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead,
always yield a new updated structure.

Database, also called an electronic database, any collection of data, or information, that
is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval by a computer. Databases are structured
to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction
with various data-processing operations.

Persistent objects are stored permanently in the secondary storage of object-oriented databases.
These persistent data and objects are shared across various applications and programs.
An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) offers computer-generated,
unique object identifiers to access each object.

Data that is set and recoverable whether in flash or memory backed. With persistent data,
there is reasonable confidence that changes will not be lost and the data will be available
later. Depending on the requirements, in-cloud or in-memory systems can qualify. We care
most about the "data" part.

The equality operator (==) is used to compare two values or expressions. It is used to compare
numbers, strings, Boolean values, variables, objects, arrays, or functions. The result is
TRUE if the expressions are equal and FALSE otherwise.
