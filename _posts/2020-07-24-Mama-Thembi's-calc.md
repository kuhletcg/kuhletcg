# Introduction
My week  was busy, I was building a calculator that mama Thembi's can use
to do simple calculations at her spaza. 
I was required to create simple web UI for the user to perform simple calculator such as addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division.

## Body
For me it's wasn't easy to build that calculator. 
The problem was that I had to use Javascript which wasn't easy. It's almost to me the week
to build it but I able to do it with HTML and CSS. But now everything is fine even Javascript.

### Conclusion
My week wasn't easy because I was busy with my assignment and some activities that we are doing every day at TCG.
