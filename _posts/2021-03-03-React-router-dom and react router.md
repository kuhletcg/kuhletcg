Title: The difference between React router and react-router-dom
Date: 2021-3-03

# Introduction

## React router

A tool that allows you to handle routes in a web app, using dynamic routing. Dynamic routing takes place as the app is rendering on your machine, unlike the old routing architecture where the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app. React router implements a component-based approach to routing. It provides different routing components according to the needs of the application and platform. The following illustration shows how react routerâ€™s dynamic routing works as compared to traditional static routing.

# Body

## What is the use of react-router?

React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a single-page web application with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component structure to call components, which display the appropriate information.

## What is the difference between React router and react-router-dom?

In v4, the react-router exports the core components and functions. react-router-dom exports DOM-aware components, like <Link> ( which renders <a> ) and (which interacts with the browser's window. ... react-router-dom re-exports all of react-router's exports, so you only need to import from react-router-dom in your project.

## Is react-router built into react?

React Router is built and maintained by React Training and hundreds of contributors.

## Example of the router

- <Route exact path="/"><Home /></Route>
- <Route path="/category"><Category /></Route>
- <Route path="/products"><Products /></Route>
- <Route path="/:id">
- <p>This text will render for any route other than '/'</p>
- </Route>

# Conclusions

In conclusion, I also learned that React is a versatile and highly modular front-end framework. Developing an application with react requires a design/mechanism of how the components are interconnected to each other to be able to serve certain functionality. Following this perspective, this post tries to breakdown the mechanism for filtering a set of a list based on certain input and render the components accordingly.
