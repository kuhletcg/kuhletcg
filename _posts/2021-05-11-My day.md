## Introduction

I will share what I was doing today during the day and the changes that I faced while I was busy with free code camp (How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project, or npm Package.
)

## Body

Today I was busy with a free code camp under the topic says "Managing packages with NPM". So I am still busy with the first change under managing packages with NPM. This topic is very tricky for me. I had to watch a tutorial. What I have learned from that tutorial is that I have to install npm and I have to check if I have I have Node.js installed, run this command in a terminal by using.

While I was watching the tutorial I came across the other word that says "Heroku" and I didn't know what is Heroku, because it was my first time seeing this word.

## What is npm?

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things.

## What is Heroku?

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

## What is Heroku Used For?

The Heroku cloud service platform is based on a managed container (called dynos within the Heroku paradigm) system. It has integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem for deploying and running modern applications.

## Conclusion

In conclusion my I have learned many things today and I am not done yet with this change. Tomorrow I will continue until I get it right. I have to put more effort into this topic because I can see is more challenging.
