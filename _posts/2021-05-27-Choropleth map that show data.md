Title: Choropleth map that show data

Today I was busy with free code camp. I was doing a project called visualize data with a choropleth map.

- I will start by explaining how does a choropleth map show data.
- Secondly, I will share the advantages of a choropleth map.
- Thirdly I will explain the difference between a dot map and a choropleth map.

Choropleth maps show interval data (data that is linked, rather than data from different categories) as colors. They are shaded in using one color, where the darker shades represent high numbers and the lighter shades represent low numbers. ... Population density can be shown using a choropleth map.

The advantages of a choropleth map are: – simple to prepare – just color the map, – easy perception – the color makes it easy for everybody to see the differences between areas, – analytic abundance – many types of data placed in one picture in a comprehensible way.

The choropleth map seen below of San Bernardino county population density uses random dots in this manner. Dot density maps, on the other hand, show the geographic density distribution of a phenomenon by placing dots representing a certain quantity of the phenomenon where they are most likely to occur.
