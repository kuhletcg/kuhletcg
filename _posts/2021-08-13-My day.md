I would like to share what I learned today.

A user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end-user or user of a system.

What is needed in the user story?

- What are they looking for?
- Why do they even need it?
- Who is the customer or the type of user?(The customer or type of user, also known as user persona).
- What user's goal for the product?
- And why is the reason the using the product or feature?
- These form a short statement from the user's perspective e.g Clearly identifies the user, their desire, and their intention.

The other thing I learned is that user stories are not exclusive to just customers though. User stories are applicable to any position or person that seeks a specific product of function.

- User stories are used to emphasize the user and address real situations that they will face.

By defining who, why and what the user story helps developers privatize product functionality and identify how a project will deliver value.
