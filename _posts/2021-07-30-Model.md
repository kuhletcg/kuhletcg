## What is a Model?

A model is a simplified representation of a system
over some time period or spatial extent intended to
promote understanding of the real system.

## Why Build a Model?

Building models helps us understand the problem
(and its surrounding system) we are investigating
solutions for. Computer software assists in
organizing information about our system, and, more
importantly, forces us to identify interrelationships
between various components of the system.
One goal for a collaborative model building process
is to generate a model focused on the
interrelationships between geographic, economic,
political, and social components of the local system.

## How Do I Make the Right

Model?
Whether a model is right or wrong is a matter of
judgement. While no model can be absolutely
correct, all models can be helpful. The extent to
which a model aids in the development of our
understanding is the basis for deciding how good
the model is.
