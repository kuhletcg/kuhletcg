 This week I was busy with basic Javascript. I was 
 doing variables, map, loop and  split.

  # Example 1:variables
  var name = "Kuhle"
  name = "Lholho"
  console.log(name) 
  The answer Will be Lholho

  ## Example 2: Map
  var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25];
var x = numbers.map(Math.sqrt)
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

### Example 3:Split
var string = "Welcome to this Javascript Guide!";
var string = string.split("").join();
console.log(string)
