Title: Basic js

 This week I was busy with basic Javascript. I was 
 doing variables, map, loop, and split.

  # Examples:

  # Variables

  var name = "Kuhle"
  name = "Lholho"
  console.log(name) 
  The answer Will be Lholho

  ## Map

  var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25];
var x = numbers.map(Math.sqrt)
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

### Split

var string = "Welcome to this Javascript Guide!";
var string = string.split("").join();
console.log(string)

#### Description:
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non consecutive number.
If the whole array is consecutive then return null
The array will always have at least 2 elements and all the elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!
*/

function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  const result = arr.find((number, index) => number !== index + arr[0])
  return Number.isInteger(result) ? result : null
}
