# Introduction

Today I was doing free code camp, code wars, type racer, and Moral activity.
He said we must create an app where people will be able to buy cars online.

# Body

## Free code camp

On free code camp, I'm doing front-end development libraries projects.

## Activity

Moral said we must create an app. Whereby people will be able to buy cars online. On that app they must be a registered car, people must
be able to view cars and then the seller may be able to see the personal information of a buyer.
So far I'm done with a form where a buyer can fill their personal information. So now I'm busy with react
the router which is not easy for me to do it but hopefully I will manage to come up with a solution.

# Solution

My day was busy.
