# Introduction

Today I was doing free code camp, code wars, type racer, and Moral activity.
He said we must create an app where people will be able to buy cars online.

# Body

## Free code camp

On free code camp, I'm doing front-end development libraries projects.

## Code wars

### Description

Make a function that returns the value multiplied by 50 and increased by 6. If the value entered is a string it should return "Error".

### Solution

function problem(x){
return (typeof x === 'number')?x\*50+6:'Error'
}

## Activity

Moral said we must create an app. Whereby people will be able to buy cars online. On that app they must be a registered car, people must
be able to view cars and then the seller may be able to see the personal information of a buyer.
So far I'm done with a form where a buyer can fill their personal information. So now I'm busy with react
the router which is not easy for me to do it but hopefully I will manage to come up with a solution.

# Solution

In conclution my day was busy.
