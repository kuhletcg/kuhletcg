Today I was looking at database design. A database is a data structure that stores organized information. ... For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees, and financial records. Each of these tables would have different fields that are relevant to the information stored in the table.

## Types of database models

Relational model. Network model. Object-oriented database model. Entity-relationship model.

The database designer is responsible for defining the detailed database design, including tables, indexes, views, constraints, triggers, stored procedures, and other database-specific constructs needed to store, retrieve, and delete persistent objects.

## Why is the database used?

Databases support good data access because Large volumes of data can be stored in one place. Multiple users can read and modify the data at the same time. Databases are searchable and sortable, so the data you need can be found quickly and easily.

## Features of the database?

It provides several key features:

- stores data in one central location.
- allows data to be shared by many users.
- provides user interfaces to work with the data.
- creates backups.
- controls who can access and edit the data.

A good database design can help save disk storage space by reducing data redundancy. Along with maintaining data precision and reliability, it allows you to access data in various ways. Moreover, a well-designed database is easier to use and maintain, making integration a breeze.
