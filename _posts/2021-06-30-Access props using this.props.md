Today I was doing research about the project that they gave us and I was also busy with free code camp. We are required to have wire frame, database, user stories and sudo code.

- The ResetPassword component should return a single div element.

- The fourth child of ResetPassword should be the ReturnTempPassword component.

- The ReturnTempPassword component should have a prop called tempPassword.

- The tempPassword prop of ReturnTempPassword should be equal to a string of at least 8 characters.

- The ReturnTempPassword component should display the password you create as the tempPassword prop within strong tags.

<ReturnTempPassword tempPassword="xxxxxxxx" />

I will state by explaining what is the wire frame.
A wireframe is a schematic, a blueprint, useful to help you and your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.

Working with wireframes may be a collaborative effort since it bridges the information architecture to the visual design. Due to overlaps in these professional roles, conflicts may occur, making wireframing a controversial part of the design process.

Since wireframes signify a “bare bones” aesthetic, it is difficult for designers to assess how closely the wireframe needs to depict actual screen layouts.

To avoid conflicts it is recommended that business analysts who understand the user requirements, create a basic wire frame and then work with designers to further improve the wireframes.
