# Introduction

My week stressing, I was busy with my assignment.

We were required to write a Reactjs TCG RSVP App. It should let you view a list of TCG events ordered by Event DateTime and have a button to RSVP to a specific event. After clicking on the RSVP button, a modal dialog should be loaded allowing a student to capture their personal details (Name Surname, Email address, Dietary Requirements). RSVPs must save to the MongoDB instance. Separate your front-end from your API code and I should be able to run your API and front-end separately.


## Body

I was stressed the whole week because of this assignment. I didn't know where to start the most thing was stressful in that we had to use MongoDB to save the information. Secondly, I had to install the server and it was my first time using the server.

But I managed to do everything that we were required to do. My RSVP can save to MongoDB and you can able to run API it using postman or insomnia.

## Conclustion

Anyway, I had a great week because I have learned how do we use MongoDB and to run API to the postman.
