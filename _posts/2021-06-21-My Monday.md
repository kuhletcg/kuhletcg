Today I was focusing on katas and I have done multiple katas and I was also busy with the project that they gave us(admin app).

## Respace all dots

The code provided is supposed to replace all the dots. in the specified String str with dashes -

But it's not working properly.

Task
Fix the bug so we can all go home early.

Notes
String str will never be null.

## Solution

- var replaceDots = function(str) {
- return str.replace(/./, '-');
- }

## Remove string spaces

Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

## Solution

- function noSpace(x){
- return x.replace(/\s/g, '');
- }

## Description: Remove exclamation marks

Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.

- function removeExclamationMarks(s) {
- return s.replace(/!/g,'');
- }
