Title: Three steps of how to Use Node.js Modules with npm and package.json

## Introduction

Because of such features as its speedy Input/Output (I/O) performance and its well-known JavaScript syntax, Node.js has quickly become a popular runtime environment for back-end web development. But as interest grows, larger applications are built, and managing the complexity of the codebase and its dependencies becomes more difficult. Node.js organizes this complexity using modules, which are any single JavaScript files containing functions or objects that can be used by other programs or modules.

## Body

## Three step of how to use Node.js Modules with npm and package.json

## Step 1 — Creating a package.json File

We begin this tutorial by setting up the example project—a fictional Node.js locator module that gets the user’s IP address and returns the country of origin. You will not be coding the module in this tutorial. However, the packages you manage would be relevant if you were developing them.

First, you will create a package.json file to store useful metadata about the project and help you manage the project’s dependent Node.js modules. As the suffix suggests, this is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file.

## Step 2 — Installing Modules

It is common in software development to use external libraries to perform ancillary tasks in projects. This allows the developer to focus on the business logic and create the application more quickly and efficiently.

For example, if our sample locator module has to make an external API request to get geographical data, we could use an HTTP library to make that task easier.

## Step 3 — Managing Modules

A complete package manager can do a lot more than install modules. npm has over 20 commands relating to dependency management available. In this step, you will:

List modules you have installed.
Update modules to a more recent version.
Uninstall modules you no longer need.
Perform a security audit on your modules to find and fix security flaws.

## Conclusion

In a Node.js project, you used npm packages as dependencies by creating and maintaining a package.json file—a record of your project’s metadata, including what modules you installed.
