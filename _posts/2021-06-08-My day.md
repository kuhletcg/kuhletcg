## Introdution

Today I spend too much time on free code too much because I realized that I was left behind so I had to push free code camp. I was busy with APIs and Microservices (Managing packages with NPM) and I'm done with it, I'm doing Basic Node and Express(Expand courses).

## Body

## What is a keyword in package JSON?

The keywords property inside a package. json file is, as you may have guessed, a collection of keywords about a module. Keywords can help identify a package, related modules and software, and concepts.

What I have noted that on the package. jon each of the keypairs has a double quote and separated by comma. It is really important to put a comma because if you don't do that everything will crash. The only time you don't need a comma is if it is the last element, If you put a comma the JSON is going to break.

I also noticed that a package. JSON file must contain "name" and "version" fields. The "name" field contains your package's name, and must be lowercase and one word, and may contain hyphens and underscores. The "version" field must be in the form x.x.x and follow the semantic versioning guidelines.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, what I have learned is that The package. JSON is used for more than dependencies - like defining project properties, description, author & license information, scripts, etc. The package-lock. JSON is solely used to lock dependencies to a specific version number.
