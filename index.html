   <p>
	  I am Sibonokuhle Nkabinde, I was born on the 27th of November 1999. I matriculated in 2019 at Sunrise secondary school.
     I am a kind person. I follow my heart and I believe in myself. I am passionate about my work because I love what I do, I
     have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. I am also ambitious and driven because I thrive on challenges and constantly set a goal for myself.
     </p>
     <p>
     I am not comfortable with settling and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. 
     I am a people person. I am also highly organized I always take notes and I use serious tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I am an indoor person. I look for positive things in all things and I also speak up. 
     My past does not determine my past I do.
     </p>

     <p>      I have started software development at the coding ground in  2020. When I started at the coding ground
          I didn't know anything about the code. In other words, I was clueless about coding. But then when time goes on I found myself interested in coding. I have learned HTML & CSS, Javascript, and react.
