	 have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. I am also ambitious and driven because I thrive on challenges and constantly set a goal for myself.
	 </p>

	 I am not comfortable with settling and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. 
     I am a people person. I am also highly organized I always take notes and I use serious tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. 
     I am an indoors person. I look for positive things in all things and I also speak up. 
     My past does not determine my past I do.
